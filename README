/************************
 * Implementation details
 *************************/

/* 
 * This section should contain the implementation details and a overview of the
 * results. 
 
 **ElevatorFactory:
 * The ElevatorFactory prompts the user for a file (using a JFileChooser) and 
 * then parses it to produce a building. As per Chase's instructions we did 
 * not spend a ton of time adding parsing code that checks for errors in the
 * input file. 
 * ASSUMPTION: We assumed, because there wasn't anything in the documentation
 * stating otherwise, that if, in the inputfile, a rider with the same ID makes
 * multiple elevator requests, that they should be treated as separate rider 
 * objects. For example if our input file was
 * 		4 3 9 4
 *		7 1 3
 *		3 4 2
 *		7 3 1
 * We would treat that as R7 wants to go from 1 to 3, R3 wants to go from 4 
 * to 2 and R7 (repeat name) wants to go from 3 to 1. If we were to treat both
 * occurrences of R7 as the same rider, we would need to make sure that R7 had
 * reached floor 3 before requesting service from 3 to 1. This would be an 
 * interesting addition to the problem but a pain. 
   

 * You are required to provide a good README document including the
 * implementation details. In particular, you can use pseudocode to describe
 * your implementation details where necessary. However that does not mean to
 * copy/paste your C code. Specifically, explain the synchronization primities
 * used in implmenting the elevator, scheduling choices used, how the capacity
 * constraint is handled, and how the mulitple elevators are supported. Also,
 * explain how to run the test cases for your EventBarrier and Elevator and how
 * to interpret the results. Check the README.OUTPUTFORMAT for the acceptable
 * input/output format for the elevator. Expect the design and implementation
 * details to be at most 2-3 pages.  A plain textfile is encouraged. However, a
 * pdf is acceptable.  No other forms are permitted.

 * In case of lab is limited in some functionality, you should provide the
 * details to maximize your partial credit.
